Blog with Node.js, Express &amp; MongoDB

This is an inspired Project from Net Ninja: 
Which allowed me to understand some basics of using Node, ExpressJs and MongoDB

Throughout this project I made a blog where i can post new content, delete, and edit them. 
By adding a user database Users can login and logout of there accounts but any account will do as it is not related to a server and uses 
a local database on mongoDB. 

This pr0ject also taught me the basics of tokens and cookies we see when click f12 > application > token 
which basically dictates the user data or the current user login (thats the context of that in this project, I could be wrong)
